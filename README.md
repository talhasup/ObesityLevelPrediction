# ObesityLevelPrediction
This project aims to predict obesity levels using machine learning, specifically employing the Random Forest algorithm. The dataset includes various health and lifestyle parameters such as age, weight, height, and physical activity levels. The target variable consists of multiple obesity categories: 'Normal_Weight', 'Overweight_Level_I', 'Overweight_Level_II', 'Obesity_Type_I', 'Insufficient_Weight', 'Obesity_Type_II', and 'Obesity_Type_III'.

Key steps in the project include:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features for accurate predictions.
Model Training: Utilizing the Random Forest algorithm to classify individuals into the specified obesity categories.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance through GridSearchCV to find the best combination of hyperparameters.
The final model shows robust accuracy and can serve as a valuable tool for early identification and management of obesity. All code and documentation are provided in this repository.
